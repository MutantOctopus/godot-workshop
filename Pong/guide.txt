Create project folder, etc
Open Godot; take a moment to explain some things
  The top left: Menus, including the Scene Menu
  Top center-left: 2D, 3D, Script, AssetLib buttons so we can change the focus of the center window
  Top center: 
download pong assets, unzip



Set resolution:
  scene menu > project settings > display > width: 640, height: 400
  set "resizable" off
  while in menu, set clear color: render > default_clear_color to black
    explain the features of the color picker at this point

return to scene view

add nodes:
  open "add node" menu, take moment to explain the difference between node types:
    gray: utility
    blue: 2D
    red: 3D
    green: control
    yellow: animation
  also touch on concept of 'inheritance': any time a node is listed under a different type of node, it 'inherits' from the parent and becomes a "more specific version" of that node
  Add basic Node2D, explain that it is something which has a Transform (Position, Rotation, and Scale) in the 2D game world.
  Rename the Node2D to "game"
  Add child Sprite nodes
    explain Sprite is a Node2D which has an image attached
    left: place at (70, 200), attach image by the 'load' feature
    note that we can use simple math in the input fields, and use it when placing the right paddle
    right: place at (640-70, 200), attach image with the 'drag and drop' feature
    separator: place at (640/2, 400/2), students can choose how to attach
    ball: same as separator

save scene as pong.tscn: explain diff between scene (.scn) files, and text scene (.tscn) files.

Input actions: Take a moment to explain them.
  input actions allow us to look for multiple different types of input (keyboard, mouse, touch, joystick, controller, etc) at once for any given thing we want to do, which is very useful to allow us to reduce code size
  go to scene menu/project settings/input map tab
